# Hypermedia-project - Curriculum Vitae
**Hypermedia project hand-in. Part 1: Create your CV website**

**Project Analysis, Information Architecture**

In designing the page’s information architecture, I aimed to create a structured layout that prioritizes accessibility and intuitive navigation. The page is divided into two main sections: a fixed sidebar and a scrollable content area. The fixed sidebar houses key personal information, allowing users to access core details such as my profile photo, brief information about me and essential skills without needing to scroll. This design choice ensures that these details are always available, creating a steady point of reference for the user.

In the scrollable content section, I include dynamic information that users can explore more deeply, such as education, work experience, and projects. This section is scrollable to accommodate future growth as I gain more work experience, participate in additional projects, and expand my knowledge of various programming languages. This layout ensures that anyone reviewing my background can easily scroll through my complete history while always having access to the most essential information about me in the fixed sidebar.

At the end of the website, there's a dedicated section where interested parties can easily get in touch with me through any of the contact methods provided.

**Project Analysis, Visual Design**

For the visual design, I chose a minimalist approach to maintain a professional look while focusing on readability and content clarity. A monochromatic color scheme with a blue sidebar and white content area enhances contrast, ensuring key information stands out without overwhelming the user. I opted for a serif font like Georgia for text, lending a professional and readable style, while section headers and titles use bold typography to create hierarchy and direct attention effectively.

Interactive elements, like the profile photo’s hover effect and links in the contact information, incorporate subtle transitions to make the interface engaging without unnecessary distractions. I used spacing and alignment to structure each section, ensuring ample white space to separate information blocks and improve readability. I've also added a color-change effect on certain sections when hovering over them to enhance readability. Additionally, in the contact section, simply clicking on any contact method will instantly connect the user with me, making it as easy as possible to get in touch.
